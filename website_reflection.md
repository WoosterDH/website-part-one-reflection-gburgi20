# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision?
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

1) I am using my website to as a portfolio and as a template to showcase my Independent Study. To do this, I experimented with different templates until I found 2 which were appropriate for a portfolio page and a page to display my I.S.
2) The greatest challenge for me was understanding what the template code meant. I had to do a lot of trial and error to figure out what code represented various functions. Eventually, I began to recognize certain bits of code and understood some of their functions. Google was also a huge help.
3) To further challenge myself, I decided to experiment with a variety of templates, some of which were too confusing or did not have the tools I needed to make the website that I wanted. Ultimately I made 3 different websites, only one of which I thought was good enough to present.
4) Finding things like links to icon pictures, putting my own pictures in, and seeing my name on display were some personal points of pride. It was a good feeling knowing that with a little prompting and guidance I can make a website on my own.

> Hi, George. I'm going to put this in the books as a 41, but that's just a placeholder for now. I'll need you to submit to me your reflection, which somehow didn't make it into this repository? If it's somewhere else on your computer, just show me and I won't take points off for lateness, but I need to have your reflection before I can finish grading.
