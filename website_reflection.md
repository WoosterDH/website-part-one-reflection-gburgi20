# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision? 
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

> Hi, George. I'm going to put this in the books as a 41, but that's just a placeholder for now. I'll need you to submit to me your reflection, which somehow didn't make it into this repository? If it's somewhere else on your computer, just show me and I won't take points off for lateness, but I need to have your reflection before I can finish grading.
